Python 3.3

Python 3.4

    - tag-mergePage.rml
    - tag-includePdfPages.rml
    - tag-registerTTFont.rml



tag-barChart.rml
tag-fixedSize.rml
tag-barChart3d.rml
tag-keepInFrame.rml

    I think these tests fail due to differences between ReportLab 2.7 and 3.0+.

    Should we drop Python 2.6 support because there's already more hacks for 2.6 than to 2/3 compatibility.

    If ReportLab have dropped Python 2.6 support then shouldn't z3c.rml follow?


rml-examples-029-keepinframe.rml

    Look at how many times we've modified this PDF to make the tests pass: https://github.com/zopefoundation/z3c.rml/commits/master/src/z3c/rml/tests/expected/rml-examples-029-keepinframe.pdf

    There's definitely a bug here and it's not just the PDF getting corrupted.

    This test passes when run by itself, but fails when the whole suite is run.

    I think I've narrowed it down to a conflict with tag-addMapping.rml as when you run both at the same time keepinframe fails.


tag-mergePage.rml
tag-includePdfPages.rml

    I think these fail due to a bug in PyPDF2 under Python 3? Needs investigating.


tag-registerTTFont.rml

    This test fails due to a bug in ReportLab 3 on line 468 in reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts.

    It's not possible to monkey patch and would require copying in a pretty big chunk of code.
