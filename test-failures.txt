Fails in Python 2 and 3
    - rml-examples-029-keepinframe.rml

    We've had problems with the keepinframe before: https://github.com/zopefoundation/z3c.rml/commit/bce7f7f25bda98a7101b3e2cf5b28fd988e505c9#commitcomment-2760056

    This test passes when run by itself, but fails when the whole suite is run.

    I've narrowed it down to a conflict with tag-addMapping.rml as when you run both at the same time keepinframe fails.


Fails in Python 3

    These tests fail but I'm not sure why. It's either bugs in PyPDF2 under Python 3 or a problem with PyPDF2 writing to BytesIO.

    - tag-mergePage.rml
    - tag-includePdfPages.rml


    This test fails due to another bug in ReportLab 3 on line 468 in reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts.

    - tag-registerTTFont.rml
