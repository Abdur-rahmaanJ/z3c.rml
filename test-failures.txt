Fails in Python 2 and 3
    - rml-examples-029-keepinframe.rml

    We've had problems with the keepinframe before: https://github.com/zopefoundation/z3c.rml/commit/bce7f7f25bda98a7101b3e2cf5b28fd988e505c9#commitcomment-2760056

    This test passes when run by itself, but fails when the whole suite is run.

    I've narrowed it down to a conflict with tag-addMapping.rml as when you run both at the same time keepinframe fails.


Fails in Python 3

    inspect.currentframe() doesn't accept a arguments in Python 3.

    In fact, I went all the way back to the Python 2.1 docs and can't find reference to it ever accepting arguments.

    Even removing the paramter makes these tests fail so we need to find an alternative.

    - rml-guide-example-05.rml
    - tag-para.rml
    - tag-index.rml
    - special-text.rml
    - tag-log.rml
    - tag-name.rml


    These tests fail but I'm not sure why. It's either bugs in PyPDF2 under Python 3 or a problem with PyPDF2 writing to BytesIO.

    - tag-mergePage.rml
    - tag-includePdfPages.rml


    This test fails due to another bug in ReportLab 3 on line 468 in reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts.

    - tag-registerTTFont.rml
