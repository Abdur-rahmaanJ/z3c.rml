RML2PDF and z3c.rml Implementation Differences
==============================================

This document outlines the differences between ReportLab Inc.'s RML2PDF
library and z3c.rml.

Incompatibilies
---------------

- ``<barCode>``

  * Most barcode attributes available via the API and the flowable are not
    supported in the drawing version in RML2PDF. I have no idea why!

  * `isoScale`: This attributes forces the bar code to keep the original
    aspect ratio. This is straight from the API.

- ``<barCodeFlowable>``

  * `widthSize`: This is called `width` in this implementation to match the
    API.

  * `heightSize`: This is called `height` in this implementation to match the
    API.

  * `tracking`: This is only used for USPS4S and the API actually uses the
    `value` argument for this. Thus this attribute is omitted.

- ``<keepTogether>``: This directive is not implemented in RML2PDF, but there
  exists an API flowable for it and it seems obviously useful.

- ``catchForms``: This feature requires PageCatcher, which is a ReportLab
  commercial product and there is no Open Source alternative.

- ``addMapping``: This is a useful API function that was supported in earlier
  versions of RML2PDF. It is now gone, but this library still supports it.

- ``drawing``: There is no documentation for this tag and I do not know what
  it is supposed to do. Thus z3c.rml does not implement it.

- ``widget``: There is no documentation for this tag and I do not know what it
  is supposed to do. Thus z3c.rml does not implement it.

To be Done
----------

Each major bullet represents a missing element. Names after the elements are
missing attributes. A "-" (minus) sign in front of an element or attribute
denotes a feature not in RML2PDF. The "->" arrow designates a difference in
naming.
